## Description
Gift Selector is a gift-finding service that helps you find the perfect gift for any occasion. Simply tell us the occasion, the relationship you have with the person, and your budget, and we'll give you a list of personalized gift suggestions.


## Context
In Month 2 of our project, we covered Node.js, ES6 syntax, OOP, Express, SQL, Sequelize, and MVC. We learned about server-side JavaScript coding, API development, database operations, and architectural patterns for organizing files and folders.
